title: "Pupil diameter differentiates expertise in dental radiography visual search"
description: "This study measured pupil responses to anomalies in dental radiographs, revealing that experts’ pupil dilation scales with anomaly difficulty while students show uniformly higher dilation. These findings indicate that experts allocate cognitive load proportionally to task difficulty, whereas students experience consistently elevated load."

Expert behavior is characterized by rapid information processing abilities, dependent on more structured schemata in long-term memory designated for their domain-specific tasks. From this understanding, expertise can effectively reduce cognitive load on a domain-specific task. However, certain tasks could still evoke different gradations of load even for an expert, e.g., when having to detect subtle anomalies in dental radiographs. Our aim was to measure pupil diameter response to anomalies of varying levels of difficulty in expert and student dentists’ visual examination of panoramic radiographs. We found that students’ pupil diameter dilated significantly from baseline compared to experts, but anomaly difficulty had no effect on pupillary response. In contrast, experts’ pupil diameter responded to varying levels of anomaly difficulty, where more difficult anomalies evoked greater pupil dilation from baseline. Experts thus showed proportional pupillary response indicative of increasing cognitive load with increasingly difficult anomalies, whereas students showed pupillary response indicative of higher cognitive load for all anomalies when compared to experts.
